## Python
Python is an object-oriented language

## Output
Output is the way the computer prints information to the user in the "console"

To output we use `print()`

## Comments
Comments are notes that the compiler skips over

To use comments, we use `# COMMENT` for single-line

we use `'''COMMENT'''` for block comments

## Data Types
We will be working with 5 main data types

1. Integer (int) - whole numbers
2. Character (char) - a single letter/symbol/number
3. String (str) - collection of characters
4. Floating point (float) - decimal numbers
5. Boolean (bool) - True/False

## Variables
Variables are containers that hold a value

### Rules for variable names
1. Always start with a letter
   `1name = "Ian"` --> NOT ALLOWED
2. Can only contain numbers, letters, and underscores ( _ ) `my name = "Ian"` --> NOT ALLOWED
3. If more than one word, use camelCase or underscores to separate words
   `myFirstName` or `my_first_name`
